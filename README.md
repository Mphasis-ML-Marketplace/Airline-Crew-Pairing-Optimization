# Airline-Crew-Pairing-Optimization
The solution uses a classical optimization based approach to derive pairings, i.e., combination of flight legs. 

## Product Overview

This solution provides an optimized solution for Airline crew pairing considering minimization of number of deadheads. Pairing is a schedule for aircraft consisting of different flight legs and each leg consists of detail of upcoming journey, such that arrival and destination airport, flight duration, and flight base etc. Deadheading occurs when off duty crew members taking a flight to a different airport for their shift. This solution considers most of the operational constraints, like flying duration, rest time between two flights,  start and end base of sequential flights etc.

## Product Highlight
* This is a classical optimization based method for crew pairing that tries to minimize number of deadheads. The alogorithm considers constraints such as minimum and maximum flying hours, number of legs in a pairing, and start and  end base should be same, etc.
* This solution is primarily focused on Airlines but can be repurposed for other use cases like trucking, railroads etc. It can help companies improve the utilization of resources while reducing the operations cost.
* Mphasis Optimize.AI is an AI-centric process analysis and optimization tool that uses AI/ML techniques to mine the event logs to deliver business insights. Need customized Machine Learning and Deep Learning solutions? Get in touch!
